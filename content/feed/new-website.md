Welcome to the latest version of my personal website! I recently finished rebuilding things from scratch using more modern tooling, and I thought it could be interesting to write up some notes about the changes I made, what I learned along the way, and what I hope to improve in the future.

I first designed and built this website back around 2018. At that point, I was pretty new to web development, and I made a few decisions that made my life increasingly difficult as time went on. The main issue (which is also something of a flex), is that the site was just a single static HTML file that used javascript to toggle between the different pages by hiding and showing elements. Over time, this started to feel messy and cumbersome to update. I also used Sass compiled by CodeKit for styling, which started to feel like an inconvenience in comparison to the tooling I currently use.

Once I decided to redo my site, I came up with a wishlist of new features I wanted:
- Improved development workflow
- Faster asset loading
- A RSS-enabled blog feed
- An embedded contact form
- Descriptions for some of the work in my portfolio

After some consideration, I decided to leave the design basically unchanged. I did mock up a few redesign concepts, but decided that I was content with the existing design and wanted to focus my attention on new functionality. Some of the concepts were pretty cool though, so get in touch if you need a portfolio website design!

To improve the development workflow and also help enable some of the other functionalities I wanted, I decided to go with Nuxt.js to rebuild the site. I generally prefer the relative simplicity of writing Nuxt over Next for more straightforward projects that don't need specific packages that only support React.
