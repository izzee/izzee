Welcome to the latest version of my personal website! I recently finished rebuilding things from scratch using more modern tooling, and I thought it could be interesting to write up some notes about the changes I made, what I learned along the way, and what I hope to improve in the future.

I first designed and built this website back around 2018. At that point, I was pretty new to web development, and I made a few decisions that made my life increasingly difficult as time went on. The main issue (which is also something of a flex, especially to my purist friends at the Recurse Center), is that the entire site was just a single static HTML file. I used a mess of convoluted javascript to toggle between the different pages by hiding and showing elements. 

Unsurprisingly, the underlying code was pretty convoluted, and the site started to feel messy and cumbersome to update over the years. I also used CodeKit to compile my Sass code, which started to feel like an inconvenience in comparison to the tooling I currently use.

Once I decided to redo my site, I came up with a wishlist of new features I wanted:
- Improved development workflow
- Faster asset loading
- A RSS-enabled blog feed
- An embedded contact form
- Descriptions for some of the work in my portfolio

After some consideration, I decided to leave the design basically unchanged and focus my efforts on new functionality 

I did mock up a few redesign concepts, but decided that I was content with the existing design and wanted to focus my attention on new functionality. Some of the concepts I came up with were pretty cool though, so get in touch if you want a portfolio website design!

To improve the development workflow and also help enable some of the other functionalities I wanted, I decided to go with Nuxt.js to rebuild the site.
